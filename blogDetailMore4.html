     <p class="revealOnScroll slow" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"><span>W</span>edding traditions are fun! They are not only rituals that are commanded by elders of the family, but ways to celebrate the historical significance of the union of marriage. Each country, religion and creed has its own rite of passage however, the underlying feature for all lies in wishing the bride and groom God's utmost blessings and celebrating their love. Here are some of the most bizarre wedding traditions happening around the world:</p>
     <ul  class="revealOnScroll slow" data-animation="fadeInUpShort">
     	<li>Congo: Brides and grooms are not allowed to smile on their wedding day. Talk about being serious about marriage!</li>
        <li>France:The couple must consume chocolate and champagne from a toilet bowl.</li>
     	<li>China:The groom must shoot at his bride in front of relatives and then collect all the arrows. Just as Cupid would do!</li>
        <li>Fiji: The groom must present his future father in law with a whale's tooth to win his bride's hand in marriage. Now that's hard work!</li>
     	<li>Kenya & Greece: The wedding audience must spit on you to ensure their blessings reach you. Raincoat, anyone?</li>
        <li>Cuba: Every man who dances with the bride on her wedding day, must clip money onto her wedding dress. This money is to be used for the honeymoon; brides are said to make as much as 1 Mill Cuban Pesos (INR 4 Lakhs)</li>
     	<li>Mongolia:The bride and groom must cut open baby chickens to find a healthy liver which stays with them until they become successful in life. Here's hoping they paid attention during all those biology lessons.</li>
        <li>Sweden: All the women at the wedding ceremony must kiss the groom everytime the bride leaves the room and vice versa!</li>
        
     </ul>
     
<p class="revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort">Some wedding traditions have not only stood the test of time, they now even have a modern variation!</p>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: The Proposal</strong></h3>
History: Formal contract between families. Often times the groom would send a group of friends or servants to state his intentions. The group would not continue on the journey if on the way they saw a monk, a nun, or a blind man. These were thought to be omens that the marriage would be doomed. If, however, they saw a nanny goat, a pigeon, or wolves, the union would be blessed with a lifetime of good fortune.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today, most couples become engaged as a matter of mutual agreement that, thankfully, has nothing to do with the sighting of omens. However, some couples still pay homage to the tradition by having the groom announce the engagement to the families after the bride-to-be has already accepted the proposal.
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Diamond Engagement Ring</strong></h3>
History: Medieval Italians believed that the diamond was created in the Flames of Love.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today, the diamond engagement ring is a symbol of the commitment made between two people and of their intention to become husband and wife. It should be noted that an engagement ring is not always a diamond. Today's rings can be of any stone the couple finds attractive.</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: The Bridal Shower</strong></h3>
History: Originally intended to strengthen friendships between the bride and her female friends, in the 1890's, it evolved into an occasion for friends to present the bride-to be with small gifts. In fact, the gifts were placed in a parasol, which was opened above the bride's head, allowing the gifts to "shower" down upon her.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today, showers come in all styles. It isn't unusual for a bride to have a lingerie shower, a stock the bar shower, a kitchen shower, etc. The style of shower can range from traditional all female affairs to large parties or barbecues that include both men and women. </div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: The Bridal Shower</strong></h3>
History: This tradition stems from the Anglo-Saxon tradition of a groom using "Brides knights" to ensure that the bride got to the wedding and got to his home after the ceremony without being attacked and the dowry stolen. As weddings became more elaborate affairs, the use of bridesmaids became more common. They were responsible for helping the bride get dressed and to help decorate for the ceremony.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today's bridal party usually consists of very close friends and family who have a special connection to the couple. It is not unusual for a bride to have a special male friend be an usher or a groom's sister to be an attendant. Modern brides thank their wedding party with small gifts of appreciation and friendship. Wedding party gifts are available at WhereBridesGo.com.
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Giving Away of the Bride</strong></h3>
History: During times when arranged marriages were the norm, the bride was literally given to the groom by her father in exchange for some form of property. 
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today, the act of "giving away the bride" is used to show support the union. Many brides today chose to have both parents escort her down the aisle, or they choose to walk unassisted to symbolize their independence.
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong> Tradition: The Veil</strong></h3>
History: During ancient times, weddings were arranged without the groom ever having seen the bride. It was thought that if the groom saw the bride and didn't like what he saw, he might not go through with the wedding. The veil was not lifted until after the ceremony. The veil was also thought to ward off evil spirits by disguising the identity of the bride.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: In this country it is unusual for couples to get married without having spent a great deal of time together. Today, the veil is a beautiful accessory that symbolizes modesty and purity. 
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>
Tradition: Wedding Dress</strong></h3>
History: Wedding dresses were not always white. In fact, until the 1840's, when Queen Victoria got married in a white gown, wedding gowns traditionally blue. In Biblical times, blue symbolized purity and fidelity-a reason that Mary, Mother of Jesus, is often depicted in blue robes.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today, brides wear wedding gowns of all colors. It has truly become a matter of personal preference. However, the most popular choices are white and ivory.
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Kissing the Bride</strong></h3>
History: In Roman times, kissing was a legal bond that sealed all contracts.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today, the kissing of the bride signifies that the marriage ceremony is complete and that the couple is now husband and wife.
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Wedding Favors</strong></h3>
History: Because the bride and groom were believed to be lucky, anything they touched was also seen as a good luck charm. Small gifts were given to wedding guests to bring them good luck throughout the year.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today wedding favors are given as a memento of the beginning of the marriage. They can range from personalized candies to engraved frames to bookmarks to centerpieces. Couples still give favors to symbolically pass on the luck! 
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Tossing of the Garter</strong></h3>
History: In the old days, guests would follow the newly married couple to their room on their wedding night, wait for them to undress, and toss their stockings at them. The first to hit the bride and groom would be the next to marry.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today, the groom removes the garter and tosses to a group of single men. The one who catches it is believed to be the next to get married. An updated version, involves the garter being auctioned off with the proceeds going to the couple for their honeymoon! 
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Tossing of the Bouquet</strong></h3>
History: This evolved from the old tradition of tearing a piece of the bride's dress for good luck. Single women would tear a piece off the wedding gown to ensure finding a husband. 
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today the bride tosses her bouquet to a gathering of single women. It is still believed that whoever catches the bouquet is the next to marry. Many brides choose to have their bridal bouquets preserved, and thus have a "disposable" bouquet ready to toss. Another modern twist on this tradition is dedicating the bouquet to someone special. The DJ can help you make this a very special part of your wedding.
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Bachelor Party</strong></h3>
History: In 5th century Sparta, a groom and his military comrades would gather on the eve of the wedding to feast and toast to good fortune.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: While not held the night before the wedding, bachelor parties are still thrown and have been the setting for some pretty wild times! Though not always scenes of complete debauchery, they represent the last hurrah for the groom before he settles down to responsible married life. Brides will often have their own Bachelorette Party too! 
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Honeymoon</strong></h3>
History: Long ago, newly married couples would drink a fermented wine made from mead and honey for a month ("moon") following their wedding.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Today the honeymoon is a vacation (not necessarily a month long!) for the newly married couple that usually immediately follows the wedding. It is a time for the couple to spend lots of time alone following the hectic planning of the wedding. Many couples choose very special places to commemorate their marriage. 
</div>

<div class=" revealOnScroll slow delay-100" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
 <h3> <strong>Tradition: Changing the Bride's Surname</strong></h3>
History: Because in olden times, women were treated as property, her name was changed to signify the change in "ownership" form father to husband. It was also believed to be bad luck to marry someone who shared the same last initial.
</div>
<div class=" revealOnScroll slow padding-T15 padding-B15" data-animation="fadeInUpShort"> 
Modern Twist: Thankfully, women are no longer viewed as property. Today's brides can choose the name they wish to use. More and more, brides are opting to keep their own names, either for professional or personal reasons. It is even common for today's brides (and grooms) to develop new names from a combination of both names!</div>
